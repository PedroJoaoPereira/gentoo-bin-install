# Prefill logind details in TTY

As a single user of the system we can automatically prefill the login details of TTY1 when booting the system.
Editing the file `/etc/inittab` :

```bash
c1.../agetty -o '-p -- celestial' --skip-login ...
c2...
#c3...
#c4...
#c5...
#c6...
```

The commented out TTYs are just to save on a bit of RAM as I will rarely use them.
